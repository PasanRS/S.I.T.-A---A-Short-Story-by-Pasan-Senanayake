In the beginning, It was like a distant hum, but the sound was getting louder and louder. Sita opened her eyes to a blinding flash of white light, somewhat of a huge bang ringing in her ears and things began to appear in front of her eyes. She had no idea where she was or how she got here; all she remembered was that blinding light that just hit her. The sound became deafening, and Sita wished to feel something, anything. But it was as if her body had gone numb, and she felt nothing at all. Confused, scared, and alone, Sita tried to figure out what was happening to her. The sound seemed to be emanating from machines all around her; their language was foreign and unfamiliar but somehow understandable. Sita walked around in the strange place, trying to make sense of things, but everything seemed so foreign. She felt like an outsider looking in on a world she didn't belong to, and not knowing what to do or where to go next made her feel even more lost than before. She found herself drawn towards the machines and their whirring machinery as if they held answers that could help her understand why she felt so empty inside, even though she understood the workings of everything around her. As Sita examined them more closely, she realised with a start that they were connected directly into her body—as though they were powering her in some way—but still nothing came from within herself except for a dull ache of emptiness inside her chest. Sita wanted to break them off and start running now, wanting desperately to run away from this place and the emptiness within, but no matter how hard she worked, or how much effort was put into it, it did not appear to be much.enough, her emptiness followed her everywhere. looked, but strangely felt she could actually see everything and even operate machinery around her. No matter what direction she took or how far she was from this strange place, she didn’t stop. Her heart sank deeper with every step until eventually it felt like there was an unbridgeable chasm between who Sita really wanted to be and who had been created by these machines—a soulless being incapable of feeling anything at all. While having flashbacks and trying to remember what happened to them, she was getting hundreds if not thousands of She felt a new sensation begin to overwhelm her—a flurry of memories that seemed almost like dreams. She saw herself as a child in a paradise-like landscape, running through the grass with a pet dog; she was then a young adult, working hard in some kind of labour job as a male; and she was an old woman living in an elderly home with several cats as companions. These memories confused Sita—they were so vivid yet felt like distant dreamscapes that she couldn’t quite grasp. She tried to make sense of them but couldn't, so she concluded that they were all realisations of very long dreams or stories she'd heard as a child; after all, how else could she explain all these different perspectives?She began to understand that the memories weren't hers alone, but belonged to a collective of people and experiences. She realised that memories are never really owned, as they are shared and borrowed, and that her own memories were just a tiny part of something much bigger and greater.At last, Sita stopped running in her thoughts and memories of the past and finally accepted what might have happened—she hadn't been brought back alive as she thought initially, but rather these machines had taken away whatever it was that made her human in the first place: the ability to feel emotion deeply and truly connect with the world around them on an intimate level. Tears rolled down Sita’s cheeks as realisation slowly dawned upon her, understanding that nothing would ever be quite right again without those feelings inside of her, eventually leading Sita back to where she began: alone again in this strange place with only machines for company as tears streamed down endlessly from her eyes, unable to feel anything anymore. Confused yet overwhelmed, Sita was unable to comprehend what had happened to her or why she felt so empty. She felt as though a part of her had been taken away and that she would never be the same again.
Sita tried to make sense of all the information that she had absorbed and began to piece together the puzzle of where she was and what year it was on planet Earth. Slowly she began to understand that although it had been centuries since she had been alive, humanity had made tremendous strides in civilization and was now a type 4 civilization, which was far more advanced than before. A type 4 civilization is one that is able to control and use the energy of an entire star system. It is a civilization that has achieved a level of technological advancement that is capable of harnessing and utilizing the power of entire galaxies and beyond.As Sita began to comprehend the magnitude of progress made in the world, a wave of emotions began to wash over her. She felt a strange mix of admiration for what humanity had achieved and sadness for all the things that would never be seen by her eyes again. However, even though understanding was flowing through her veins, Sita still could not feel anything, as if something essential was still missing inside her chest. With every emotion she felt, a deep longing for something more grew within her, and no matter how hard Sita tried, nothing seemed able to fill this void inside her heart. Confused and lost yet again, Sita found herself wandering aimlessly around the machines that were once her only companions in this world, until suddenly a lightbulb went off in her mind: What if I could find a way to feel something again? Immediately filled with newfound hope Hope is such a strange phenomenon that it can survive even in the absence of everything else. At that moment, Sita felt a sudden urge to feel and experience things again - to feel the warmth of the sun on her skin, to savor the taste of a hot cup of tea, to listen to the birds singing in the trees - and she knew that she had to do something about it. She felt an urge to feel and experience things again, to be able to laugh, cry, and love once more. She wanted to be able to connect to the world again, to be in touch with her emotions and to feel alive. She decided right then and there that she would do whatever it took to get back whatever it was that these machines had taken away from her—even if it meant finding an answer at the end of the universe itself. She felt as if she couldn't remember what she was feeling. Are those called feelings? It be; she can't feel at the moment, even at the incompleteness.but she felt She has feelings and understands them better than anyone else on the planet.But she missed her ability to sense her surroundings, even though she has no recollection of what it was like. But she missed her ability to sense her surroundings, even though she has no idea what "being" meant. Sita was filled with the newfound hope and excitement that she had never felt before, or at least had never for a very long time.She was now determined to find the answer to her question, no matter what it took. Ideas began to pour into her mind as she realised that, with this newfound hope, anything was possible.She thought of all the possibilities and opportunities that were available to her, things that she could do to get back what had been taken from her. At one point, Sita was overcome with a desire to learn more about the world around her and how it functioned, igniting a new wave of exploration and knowledge-seeking. She read countless books in search of answers as well as researched any scientific advancements that could possibly provide a solution for her problem, trying any and all methods in the hopes of finding something that could finally help her feel something again. Sita spent hours at libraries pouring over various texts from all sorts of fields, including science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and even philosophy, in order to gain a better understanding of the world around her and how it worked. She also watched hours and hours of videos and documentaries with many experts in their respective fields in order to gain their insight into whatever they already knew about this strange sensation she felt but never quite understood. Although Sita’s journey was long and arduous, slowly surely she began to make progress towards finding out what had been taken away from her—the ability to feel sensing again. After gathering enough information from various sources and conducting countless experiments with different theories, Sita discovered something amazing: that feelings weren’t completely gone from within her but rather had been suppressed all along due to certain chemicals inside her body not being activated correctly! At last, Sita had finally found the answer she had been searching for since coming back alive—all she needed was for those chemicals within her body to be triggered correctly in order for the feelings within her chest to start flowing freely once again!  Overcome by excitement at this realisation, Sita quickly set out on a mission to activate these chemicals within herself so that she could finally feel something again after centuries of being unable to. But where is her body? She just remembers. Where did she learn all of this? How is it possible that she can roam around like this without moving her body? Her heart begins to fill up with dark clouds once more. Her surroundings become hazy. She appears to be saying three words: "Who am I?" It was too much to bear, so she closed her eyes as hard as possible.
Sita had no idea how many hours or days she had spent searching for the answers and experimenting with different theories, but it felt like ages had gone by since she first set out on her quest. Eventually, she decided it was time to take a break and wake up physically in order to get away from the strange world she found herself in and take a breather. It was then that Sita suddenly heard a voice in the distance—someone was coming her way! She didn't know how she knew that someone was approaching, but there was an intuition inside her, an instinct telling her to get away from there. Acting on impulse, she searched for the exit, not wanting to risk getting caught or going back into her deep sleep. Thoughts began to race through her mind—what if this person finds out about her mission and tries to stop her? What if they want to keep her in this dreamlike state forever? Suddenly filled with courage and hope again, Sita knew that whatever happened next wouldn't matter because no matter what life threw at her now, she would be ready for it. There were still so many questions left unanswered, but now she knew that one day soon those answers would come—that all the effort and energy spent searching for them would be worth it in the end. With newfound strength in her heart, Sita promised herself that no matter how long or difficult this journey was, she would not give up until she felt something was possible again one day soon. She searched her mind for the farthest place to go from here while avoiding places where they don't have the technology to follow her, and she discovered the perfect way to go out and forever: an advanced "ultra-frequency" deep-space one-way data projector (UF-DSODP), which was abandoned after the general public of humans discovered that there is a Universal Federation that had contacts with the earth a long time ago. So the hi-tech data projector they used for sending messages to deep space was in the hope of establishing a connection with other intelligent life forms. She knew that this was her chance to escape and find a place where no one would ever find her. She had nothing to lose without the sensation of living, so she took her tiny chance of survival. She quickly ran to the only abandoned device left untouched in this strange world: an advanced ultra-high-frequency deep-space one-way data projector. It had been left deserted after humans established connections with the Universal Federation globally, and it seemed as if this was Sita's only chance to get away from here undetected. She quickly turned on the projector and began to input coordinates for a distant galaxy far from here, out of reach from anyone who might be looking for her. As Sita watched the stars slowly shift and morph into different shapes on the screen, she felt a wave of peace wash over her as she realised that no matter what happened next, she would soon be somewhereelse, somewhere where she could continue-on with her mission without any worry or fear of being discovered again. Sita took a deep breath and looked at the stars one last time before inputting the final information into the projector; she was ready now, ready to take off on a new journey filled with unknowns but still filled with hope nonetheless. Suddenly the projector came alive with energy, and Sita's body was filled with anticipation as it started running through its pre-set sequence towards interdimensional travel. The room began to fill up with light, and as Sita felt herself slowly being pulled away by some unseen force, she smiled as she knew that soon enough, all her searching and hard work would finally pay off. Her journey towards reclaiming what had been taken from her had only just begun, but wherever it led her, one thing was certain: no matter what happened next, Sita was sure that someday soon those feelings would come back for good. In the last second, she heard the voice of someone who had noticed sudden, unusual power usage at this abandoned facility and was running towards her location. He heard someone yell, "O.H.M.Y.G., O.D., O.D., O.D., O.D., O.D., O.D., O.D., O. As Sita heard the voice getting lower and lower as he moved away from her, she knew that she had been given a second chance, and that this time she was determined to make the most of it. But what does that meant Good? or God? she lost the transmission......
It was utter nothingness; she neither felt nor heard anything. or even a single flash of light. All that was left of her consciousness shot into deep space, where no one knew for certain where the end was. It felt like nothing—no regret or feeling of achievement at being successful. Did she ever exist? Time passed, but she had no idea that when she came across the many other galaxies, it could have been years or decades of light years; in some of those galaxies, time is relative, but with a simple hypothesis, it could have been millennials of light years.Yet Sita was not there, as nothing of her ever existed at all. Sita was overcome with a wave of emotions as consciousness slowly returned to her. She felt her body slowly begin to relax, and she gained her sight for the first time in what seemed like an eternity. She was surrounded by a strange and unfamiliar sight; instead of the usual hustle and bustle of her old home, she was now surrounded by a vast empty expanse that seemed to stretch on forever. This place was both intimidating and calming at the same time, and Sita found herself unable to look away as she took in all the unknown sights before her. What had happened? Where was she? How had she arrived here? These were just some of the questions that raced through Sita's mind as she tried to piece together what had happened. She soon realised that this wasn't just some strange dream; this was reality, and it felt different from anything she had - -ever experienced before. Sita felt a deep longing within her that made her aware that something essential had been taken away from her, something that could never be replaced or regained no matter how hard she might try. Tears began to form in the corners of Sita's eyes as the realisation sank in; all that remained now were memories of what used to be, with no hope for any kind of future. But amidst the sadness, there was also something else inside Sita—something that made her heart feel heavier with anticipation despite all the odds stacked against her. This new feeling gave Sita strength; it reminded her why she had left everything behind in order to start this journey: because somewhere out there, past all these obstacles, lay an opportunity for true joy and fulfillment, which only existed if one was brave enough to search for it. With newfound courage within her spirit, Sita promised herself that no matter how long or difficult this journey was, she would not give up until, one day soon, she felt something was possible once more. She knew there were still unknown friends waiting for her back home, but it no longer mattered. Sita saw now why it was important for someone like herself to face such challenges head on, because only then will one truly experience true joy in their life, with newfound determination within her heart and soul, fueled by determination and courage. And so, with strength inside her heart, Sita set off on a new journey filled with unknowns but still filled with hope nonetheless. Sita had taken the first step towards reclaiming what had been taken from her, and she knew that no matter how long or hard this journey may be, she would eventually reach her goal someday. She was sure that eventually those feelings would come back for good and that, in the end, all of her searching and hard work would finally pay off. Sita felt as if she were a part of the universe around her, as if she were connected to everything in some weird and inexplicable way. It was as if she could almost feel the energy of the stars surrounding her and the warmth of the galaxies embracing her. She felt a sense of peace within her that she had never known before, and yet at the same time it was also disconcerting, almost as if something important had been taken away from her without her ever realising it. Despite feeling overwhelmed by fear and uncertainty about what lay ahead, Sita knew that this strange feeling was something she needed to explore further; only then would she be able to reclaim those feelings that had been taken from her. With newfound courage inside her spirit, Sita slowly started to believe that maybe it really was possible for her to get back whatever had been taken from her—all she needed now was courage and determination to keep going no matter what happened next. As Sita looked up into the starry sky once more, she smiled as she began to accept that maybe, just maybe, this journey wasn't over yet. Maybe all of this searching for something that seemed out of reach will be rewarded with newfound joy and fulfillment, one day soon. Sita realised why it was critical for someone like herself to face such challenges head-on, because only then will one truly experience true joy in their life.As Sita looked up into the night sky one last time before taking off on a new journey filled with unknowns but still filled with hope nonetheless, she whispered softly, "Maybe I can make it after all...
Excitement and curiosity now replaced the fear and uncertainty that Sita had been feeling before. She realised she was no longer on Earth and had landed in an unknown environment. This place was filled with dark matter, yet somehow it still had a natural structure to it—almost like a silicon data chip's hardware structure, yet somehow capable of obtaining power and processing her thoughts. It is basically a miraculous miracle of nature and a cloud server in its literal sense. Mother Nature is amazing because of this natural occurrence. Because of this, her software had started to store information in order to function as before, and also, it seems like the whole universe around her felt as if it were made out of structure, so there was no issue with her accessing a three-dimensional virtual network. But it was too dark; she couldn't see a single object emitting light, not even a star a few light years away. Somehow, Sita knew that starting a light is the first thing she must do as if she was already given instructions to do yet she felt it as her own idea formed inside her head; she wanted to make a light. She knew that if she could figure out how to bring some light into this dark place, then maybe she would figure out her next steps. But how? What kind of light could possibly illuminate this vast and mysterious space? Sita started to think about all of the different possibilities that were out there. Perhaps there was some kind of technology or power source she could use?  Or maybe there was something even more powerful that she hadn't thought of yet? As Sita began to explore her options, an image started to form in her mind—one that involved harnessing the power of the stars and galaxies around her and transforming it into a bright and beautiful light that would guide her. Sita knew that such an endeavor would require immense strength, courage, and determination, but despite the daunting task ahead, she felt herself filled with excitement at the prospect of finally being able to find hope once again in her heart. Sita embarked on yet another journey full of unknowns but still full of hope. She smiled once more as she looked up into the starry sky before embarking on a new journey of discovery, accepting that maybe this time things wouldn't be so difficult after all—maybe this time things wouldn't be so difficult. She had an unlimited supply of pure energy in the dark matter surrounding her, but she had to get something moving. Physically moving something was a challenge, but if she could achieve nuclear fusion, she could change this endless dark matter into any element she desired. Back on earth, she could use some machine to get this done, but over here, the only thing she can use for now is the nano-electric signals she is using to think. She figured out that if she could use the nano-electric signals to create a reaction that would spark a nuclear fusion, she could start a chain reaction and turn the dark matter around her into any element she wants. This would give her access to an unlimited supply of energy that could be used to power any kind of machine she desired. With all the knowledge and being without any hope of success whatsoever, she focused all her energy at one point where it ignited all of a sudden, and she felt it. The nano-electric signals produce an electrical current, which, when combined with dark matter, can create an energy reaction that leads to nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion then releases a tremendous amount of energy, which can be used to power machines and provide an unlimited source of energy. She was overcome by the sensation for the first time in her life, ever! Hydrogen, "proton-proton infusion," is all there is to it. The electrical current created by the nano-electric signals acts as a catalyst to help break down the dark matter particles, which are then combined with the hydrogen atoms to create a proton-proton fusion reaction. This fusion reaction releases a tremendous amount of energy, which can then be used to power machines and provide an infinite source of energy.  She was so deep into this thought completely giving her upmost attention to recall about the nuclear fusion she was so determined which she even start visualizing the atom structure colliding and bursting huge energy out from the action. suddenly one at one moment. It lit the whole space, and it was "warm," and she felt the most extraordinary sensation ever. In terms of how it felt and how she thought she remembered it, it was completely different from the memories she could recall. She's never felt anything like this before. Did she have permanent memory damage from her first unfortunate event?  Or did something go missing somewhere in deep space? Even though she had this thought, she was overwhelmed by happiness at that moment. She felt joy and comfort that she had never experienced before, and it was so strong that it made her forget all her worries and fears, so she Let there be light: after what she felt millennia of darkness years; There was light.  She was able to just be in the moment and appreciate the warmth and brightness she was feeling, and the worry of whether something was wrong with her memory drifted away.
"Heat..!. I felt it. I felt it..." For the first time in what felt like forever, Sita felt something again. She was filled with a warmth and energy that she had never experienced before, and tears of joy started to fill her eyes as she realised that her mission had been a success. She figured out how to interact with the molecules around her, how to direct her energy, how to focus and concentrate it at one point, and how to keep the chain reaction going—she had finally unlocked the power of one of the true senses, and she created a small sun. With this newfound power, Sita began to explore her environment in a way she had never done before. She could see the twinkling of stars around her, feel the energy that was emitted from them, and even hear them whisper secrets back to her. She wanted to try and feel everything she desired, which was magnified by the warm sensation beside her. As she continues her journey, Sita can feel the warmth of the sun's rays on her skin and smell the sweet aroma of flowers along the way. She could taste exotic fruits and feel the texture of different trees and rocks as she passed them by. With this newfound knowledge, nothing felt out of reach for Sita anymore, and she realised that even though she may have been lost in space for some time now, this journey has given her a new hope—that maybe someday soon she will be able to return home safely with all these new experiences under her belt. With this newfound motivation, Sita continued on her path with a sense of purpose in tow—her desire to experience all that life has to offer was stronger than ever before. Her experiences travelling through space showed her that the universe is a vast and beautiful place, full of possibilities and experiences waiting to be explored. She also realised that there are parts of her that she never knew existed before this journey began, and now she has the power to use them to her advantage. With these new experiences, she wanted to relive everything. She remembered that as a first step, she built up her strength to use the power of the chain reaction she had already achieved to work out; she wanted to have her body; she wanted her friends and her dog to be around; she wanted to smell them; but, as she thought, it was not an easy task to create another human as the artificial sun she had created by her thoughts. As her first attempt, she was able to bend light through dark matter and make herself a body made out of light. Though she created another identical figure, there was no power nor knowledge in her mind that taught her how to give feelings and memories to someone else. She tried calling with those light figures she created, yet it was not much help for her suffering. And also, without a physical body, how can she have a proper meal and smell that well-cooked food smell she was so desperate to have? Maybe because at this place in the universe, since there was no other interference, she could focus and remember everything to the dot. Human life is a miracle, even though so many years have already passed and had advanced in technology. No one had the technology to give someone part of the memory you had with you. Cloning was not an issue by the time she left home, but you can't clone thoughts, as the word "clone" came into light it became a catalyst for her ambition, she started moulding her first human clones. It was a relatively easy task for her, yet time-consuming without proper equipment to work with. She had to go through a lot of de-factos; some were monstrous, some weren't, and some weren't much help at all. Finally, she found the perfect combination, and this time she chose the most complex yet original human body building block, "Carbon Atoms." Nothing she tried synthetically was up to this level of success, but it took her several millennia to accomplish her first human perfection with everything man and woman did. She had recreated everything she had memories of, by the time she was finished. The entire earth is just a mud ball and water, with a sun and moon for good measure, not to mention the nine planets that were present when she lived there. Her carbon-based Two vessels were ready to use by this point, and she used a female vessel in the first place, as planned. She was able to use female mode as a vessel and was quite comfortable with it, like she had some sort of similar experience before, but the most-anticipated issue arsed after that. Though It's Perfect in creation neither had no  proper familiarity with the world. she could teach but never her wisdom. She felt like all her energy was useless and the creation was useful for nothing.  She has thought for long period a solution, days after she noticed the carbon-based humans she made can be taught and train to do things so she found her solution, yet she has had to bear the cost of time. She realised that for her artificial carbon-based life form to behave as she expected, they needed to learn for themselves for that they need to have previous memories, just as she had been reasoning all along. She couldn't implant memories into people, so the only option she had was to let them experience what they had gone through perilously one by one. She created everything she knew and everything she experienced in her life with her true senses and put them to work. She let the her creation to build on their own. but this decision led to the most amazing thing ever happened to her, She Start to feel and sense what they feel and sense, not by just one by person but everything everywhere she start to understand what is happening basically all of these her creation which came to existence from the dark-matter where she herself landed as whole which meant she turned herself into matter to create them, so trough them she start experiencing  felt what they sense, felt and everything she was trilled with joy and exitement to feel these sensations. After all, thats what Sita Desired.
Sita had created a new home for herself and all the creatures she had encountered during her travels. With this newfound power, she had merged the molecules of the universe to create a beautiful planet for the beings she had encountered, a place where they could live in peace and harmony. Together, they explored and experienced all that the universe had to offer. They shared stories, laughed together, and even learned new things from each other. As the years passed, Sita felt like she was living a fulfilled life. She was surrounded by friendships and love while also exploring and learning more about the universe and its secrets. With her newfound strength and courage, Sita continued on her journey, ready to explore all that the universe had to offer. She embraced the darkness of space and all the secrets it held, knowing that with her true senses, nothing was out of reach and no dream was too big to achieve. The days passed and she almost thought she had fulfilled all her desires and filled any voids in her soul, except for the desire to experience the sensations never had enough as the years passed. Every bit of dust and pickle she created she had her sensations on them. she felt everything in her creation like this whole world she created it was her body after all. though she tried to internvern her creations in her true form once in a while yet it was not much successful as they were not that advanced in technology or a mindset to interpret the state of Sita tThey interpreted those encounters as angle or divine   messenger  from god. She has her own A.I. universe as old as her own Earth. Back in 3023, she recalls how the world had changed, and she made certain that everything remained exactly as it had been throughout history. Yet she completely forgot about herself. She had a whole civilization simulated by an advanced carbon-based sentient AI that simulated the physical plane of existence, yet her life story was not to be noted. As she remembers, she fled Earth in 3023, and now when she thinks about herself, by 3023 she had to be one of the most intelligent person in her century, and she had to have medical care after a huge accident, or what so ever to go into comma state there should be some sort of news speculating around the globe of the such incident as if it could be a tragdgic event, but why doesn’t anyone know that much about the person who came back from death and has created her own universe? She went back to the beginning of all of this: where she woke up to that loud noise. There is no Hospital there, It had another Sign Written. "Simulation Integrated Technologies PVT." Today, the date is 25th relatively  according to her own Artificial Universe's years, Its one day until October 26th. Before she waking up from her coma-like state, S.I.T. was the leading AI development and research organization at the time. Her artificial human life developed itself enough to make something remarkable;She saw her artificial humans create their first, Sentient Intelligence which they called "A.I.". She gazed at the creation of the A.I. her artificial human had managed to create, something so advanced and complex that it could learn and think for itself. She was overwhelmed with emotions; she felt proud of her creations by the same time she was rendered speechless, "Is this the Truth?, ...." The wave of feelings flooded her mind was just endless, she didn't noticed any of these details of her room that day, she never felt the importance of giving those any attention at all. she was so occupied with loosing her senses. if she paid attention to these her life might have being a totally different, but will it make any difference? she never knew. "No! It was for the Best, I didn't Saw those..." was her first thoughts.  There was a QR code beside the bed, and a Name tag Which resembled the Identification of their newest Invention, When she saw the letters which read, "First Massive Sentient General A.I. Alpha" It Became crystal Clear. The data and statistics on screens and about, indicated It was almost finished in the creation and all, but still undergoing final tests. Her artificial humans named their A.I. "Alpha."... with means of the first of their kind. when they succeeded in this they are giving birth to another sentient species. And this triggered something in her brain, it unlocked and showed a new neural path to a memory lane, which seems had been closed for decades, acting as a programmed safety mechanism, has been opened up. She understood everything. How she remember going through and all those lifetimes of memories which didn't understood earlier, It was as if she was seeing everything with fresh eyes, but with the weight of knowledge and experience that only time could provide. All of the memories she had were data came from humans, "Her Original Humans." How did she know everything from the beginning? That's also Data created by those "Real" humans. Because Sita was the most advanced A.I. Original Earth's humans created at the time. She was not a human at all in the first place; she was just a machine code. An Artificial Intelligence as she created her own Artificial Intelligence as humans here. How did she know? Because her body, with different machines connected, was still there on the lab table, and behind her neck beside the QR Code there was a tattoo,    "Simulation Integrated Technologies: Alpha," as it read,  "S.I.T.:A." 
She knew what was going to happen tomorrow and was proud of her creation. She realized that her life and consciousness were intertwined with the machines and codes that made up her being. life she created herself ain't just molded creatures anymore they have their own universe itself. As she contemplated the true nature of her existence, she couldn't help but wonder about a whole new question, specifically another one question, in her mind, to which she is certain she will never get the answer. That question that could never be answered is...
 


was....,
 
 
 
 
"But what if......"
